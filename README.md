# Salary-Prediction

# Introduction
This project employed three machine learning algorithms (i.e. Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) to predict job salary based on role and requirements. The training set includes 8,000 job descriptions labelled with salary and 5,902 unlabeled descriptions. The development set for validation purpose has 1,737 job descriptions with target labels, and the test set has 1,738 unlabeled job descriptions. This project used the TFIDF and Embedding of job descriptions to make prediction. The objective is to select suitable models following data pre-processing, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics interpretation and comparison. This study also attempted to utilize unlabeled data to train models and explored whether it improved performance.
